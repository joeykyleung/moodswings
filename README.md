## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML/Jinja2 Templates
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with Spotify API
- **API Integration**: Spotify Web API
- **Async Operations**: httpx for asynchronous HTTP requests

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Spotify API Integration
- **Challenge**: Managing OAuth 2.0 flow and token handling
- **Solution**: Implemented a robust authentication system using FastAPI's dependency injection and session management

### 2. Playlist Management
- **Challenge**: Efficient handling of playlist operations (creation, updates, deletions)
- **Solution**: Created a dedicated `playlistHandler` class with async methods for optimal performance

### 3. Mood-Based Song Selection
- **Challenge**: Mapping emotional states to musical attributes
- **Solution**: Developed a sophisticated algorithm using Spotify's audio features (valence, energy, tempo) to match songs with emotional states:
  - Happy: High valence (>0.7), high energy (>0.55)
  - Sad: Low valence (<0.3), low energy (<0.45)
  - Angry: High energy (>0.6), high loudness (>-5dB)
  - Neutral: Balanced valence (0.4-0.7)
